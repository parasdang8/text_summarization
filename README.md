# text_summarization.py
The Text Summarization Project aims to develop a system that can generate concise and coherent summaries of long text documents, capturing the main ideas and key information while preserving the original meaning and context.

This project involves:

Preprocessing the text data by tokenization and cleaning.
Selecting appropriate summarization techniques such as extractive or abstractive methods.
Evaluating the generated summaries for coherence and accuracy.
The deployed system will enable users to summarize large volumes of text efficiently, facilitating information retrieval, document understanding, and decision-making across various domains such as news aggregation, document summarization, and meeting transcripts analysis.
